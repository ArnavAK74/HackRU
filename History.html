            <h2>Ancient Bridges</h2>
            <p>Bridges have played a crucial role in human civilization (4000 BC), enabling the movement of people, goods, and ideas across natural barriers.
            The earliest bridges were made of fallen trees or simple stone slabs placed across streams, but as civilizations advanced, so did bridge construction.
            The ancient Mesopotamians and Egyptians built early stone bridges, while the Romans perfected the use of arches and concrete, creating some of the most durable bridges in history.
            During the medieval period, wooden and stone bridges became more common, often featuring fortified towers for defense. The Industrial Revolution brought major advancements with the use of iron and steel, allowing for longer and stronger bridges.
            Engineers like Isambard Kingdom Brunel and John Roebling pioneered new designs, leading to the creation of suspension bridges that could span great distances. </p>

            <h2>Modern Bridges and Types</h2>
            <p>Today, bridges come in many types, each designed for specific needs and environmental conditions. <strong> Beam bridges </strong>, the simplest type, use horizontal beams supported by piers, while <strong> arch bridges </strong> distribute weight efficiently through a curved structure.
                <strong> Suspension bridges </strong>, such as the Golden Gate Bridge, use cables to support the deck, allowing for long spans and flexibility. <strong> Cable-stayed bridges </strong>, which use towers and cables for support, are a modern alternative to suspension bridges, often seen in urban and coastal areas.
                <strong> Truss bridges </strong>, known for their triangular framework, provide strong yet lightweight support for railways and highways. Advances in materials like reinforced concrete, high-strength steel, and even carbon fiber have allowed for the construction of increasingly complex and resilient bridges,
                ensuring their continued importance in global transportation and infrastructure.</p>
